# Design specification

Here is some interaction design thoughts. Tests should be re-written based
on these specifications.

## Open issues

### Leaving a group

#### If the user has posted videos

What should happen if the user tries to leave a group after posting some videos
there. Should the user be explicitly told to remove the videos first or just
automatically unlinking the videos from the group. Other option is to leave the
videos to the group, but this complicates the interface and relations. In that
case the user _must_ be able to take their videos down from the group.
