# Ach so Web UI and backend

- Works as an adapter for the SocialSemanticServer
- Provides a web player for playing and annotating Ach so! videos with common web browsers.
- Stores 'manifest' files, pieces of additional metadata for videos that allows them to have achso-style annotations.  

Web player
----------

If you have a 3rd party service that encounters Ach so! videos, they will have a long id as part of the URI, e.g. `"4e0e3dba-82f6-42eb-9a82-fda064ad3f29"`. To view such video in the web player, you will need to know which achrails server the video is stored, and compose an url in the format `$server + "/videos/" + $long_id + "/player"`. With previous example id this would create something like: `http://achdemoserver.org/videos/4e0e3dba-82f6-42eb-9a82-fda064ad3f29/player`. The web player for given video id will be in this address.  

The web player can also be embedded. It adjusts itself to given size:
```html
<iframe src="http://achdemoserver.org/videos/4e0e3dba-82f6-42eb-9a82-fda064ad3f29/player" width="500" height="300" allowfullscreen=""/>
```

The web player can be provided with an anchor t to give a starting time for playing. `.../player#t=2s`would start the video from 2 second point. Time must be provided in seconds and it can include decimals.
